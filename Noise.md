# Noise
[[Voltage|Voltages]] are often not exact. Digital logic is noise tolerant which means $0.9 + 0.4 = 1$. This ensures stable and consistent calculations, even if the [[Voltage|voltages]] is not perfect. Analog circuits interprets $0.9 + 0.4$ as $1.3$

## How does noise get introduced?
Anything, even something as simple as a nearby cellphone can alter [[Voltage|voltages]]. More commonly, very small differences all throughout the electrical component collectively make a difference.
