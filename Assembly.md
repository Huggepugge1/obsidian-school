# Assembly
Assembly is the same as machine language but all [[instruction]]s, [[register]]s, etc. has gotten string tags so that it is human readable. 

## Different Types of Assembly
Assembly is not a programming language, but rather a type of language. Every [[instruction set]] has its own kind of assembly with many popular such as [[x86_64]] having multiple. These are called flavors.

## Translation To Machine Code
==OBS! All examples are in [[MIPS]]. This is not the same as other ISAs. Though the same principles apply.==
### Example
`add R8, R17, R18` -> `00000100 01100100 10000000 0100000`
