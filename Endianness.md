The bytes in a [[Binary Number]] can be ordered left to right or right to left. This is called endianness. If the order is from left to right (big endian) the first [[Byte]] in [[Memory]] is the largest. If the order is from right to left (little endian), the first [[Byte]] in [[Memory]] is the smallest. Some systems support both (BI-endian). Note that the [[Bit|bits]] in the the [[Byte|bytes]] are always ordered in the same way, smallest to largest is right to left.
