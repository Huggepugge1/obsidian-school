# Endianness
The bytes in a [[binary number]] can be ordered left to right or right to left. This is called endianness. If the order is from left to right (big endian) the first [[byte]] in [[memory]] is the largest. If the order is from right to left (little endian), the first [[byte]] in [[memory]] is the smallest. Some systems support both (BI-endian). Note that the [[Bit|bits]] in the the [[Byte|bytes]] are always ordered in the same way, smallest to largest is left to right.
