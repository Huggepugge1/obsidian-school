# Dynamic [[Random Access Memory]]
Dynamic [[random access memory]] (DRAM) is similar to [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]] but uses capacitors instead of latches. This results in having to refresh the data every once in a while (capacitors lose charge over time) and also, reading data uses up the charge. Therefore the charge must be rewritten after reading. The reason DRAM is used is because it is 6-10 times smaller and way cheaper than [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]]. The reason [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]] is faster than DRAM is that the charge in the capacitors are way smaller than in the latches of a [[Static Random Access Memory|SRAM]] cell.
