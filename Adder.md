An adder is a component in an [[Arithmetic Logical Unit]] that adds two [[Binary Number|binary numbers]] together through [[Binary Addition]].

# Half Adder
A half adder takes two [[Bit|bits]] $A$ and $B$ as inputs and outputs the sum $S$ and [[Carry]] $C$. Because the half adder only works with [[Bit|bits]], $S$ and $C$ are both [[Bit|bits]] themselves.

# Full Adder
A full adder is a three input adder. The inputs are $A$, $B$, and $C_{in}$ where $C_{in}$ is a [[Carry]] from the last adder. The outputs are the sum $S$ and [[Carry]] $C_{out}$. If the adder only uses one [[Bit]] it is called a one [[Bit]] adder, but these adders can add bigger numbers than just one [[Bit]].
