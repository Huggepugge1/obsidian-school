# Dining Philosophers
Five philosophers are sitting at a table. In front of them they have a bowl of rice. All philosophers want to eat the rice but in order to eat the rice, a philosopher needs to have two chopsticks. On the table there are five chopsticks. If every philosopher is egocentric, there is a possibility of no one ever eating their rice due to everyone only having one chopstick each.
