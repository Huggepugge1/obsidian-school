The voltage of a electron is how much energy that electron is carrying. Voltage is denoted as V and measured in Volts (V).

# Formulas
- Watt's law: $V = P / I$ -> Voltage = [[Power]]([[Watt|watts]]) / [[Current]]([[Ampere]])
- Ohm's law: $V = I * R$ -> Voltage = [[Current]]([[Ampere]]) * [[Resistance]]([[Ohm|Ohms]])
