# Stack
The stack is a part of the [[memory]]. The stack is special because it always has a [[pointer]] pointing to it. In [[MIPS]] this pointer is located in R29 / $sp but this differs depending on architecture. Stacks grow down. This means that the [[Stack Pointer|SP]] decrease as the stack grows.
